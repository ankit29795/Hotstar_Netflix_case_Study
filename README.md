# Hotstar_Netflix_case_Study
A digital media company (similar to Voot, Hotstar, Netflix, etc.) had launched a show. Initially, the show got a good response, but then witnessed a decline in viewership. 
The company wants to figure out what went wrong.

# Primary Goal:
To understand the viewership decline of XYZ show

# Potential Causes:
1. Less number of people coming to platform
2. Less number of people watching the video
3. Decline in marketing spend
4. Competitive shows, e.g. cricket World cup, IPL
5. Special Holidays
6. Twist in the story such as death of a particular character
So, in total, we built around various models with Stats Model Api before we arrived at the final model

We identified some of the variables as the driver variables that could be used to increase the viewership of the show. 
Ad impressions are directly proportional to the marketing budget. Thus, by increasing the marketing budget, a better viewership could be achieved. Similarly, 
Character A’s absence and presence create a significant change in show viewership. Character A’s presence brings viewers to the show.
 Thus, these two variables can be acted upon to improve the show viewership.

# Interpreting the Results
It is not always possible to change the script of the story at a moment’s notice. Character A’s dates might also not be available.
 Thus, the marketing team can focus on the ad impressions instead.
